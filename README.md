## Technical Features

- AI-Driven Generation: Orchestrates professional UI component generation through structured natural language processing.
- Real-Time Streaming Middleware: Implements live AI response streaming for instantaneous feedback loops.
- Identity and Access Management: Secure authentication architecture utilizing GitHub and Google OAuth providers, implemented via Passport.js and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Unified Design System: Comprehensive UI framework built on Tailwind CSS 4, Motion, and Hugeicons for a standardized, responsive interface.
- Data Persistence: Manages session history and creative assets through a scalable storage layer.
- Monorepo Infrastructure: Optimized development workflow using Turborepo and pnpm for efficient workspace management.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (apps/web)

- Framework: Next.js 16+ utilizing App Router and Server Components.
- Styling: Utility-first CSS via Tailwind CSS 4 with PostCSS.
- Animations: Declarative motion logic using Framer Motion.
- State Management: Lightweight client state with Zustand and server state synchronization via TanStack Query.
- API Client: Type-safe communication layer powered by tRPC.

### Backend (apps/api)

- Framework: NestJS 11 for a modular, scalable server-side architecture.
- Persistence: TypeORM with PostgreSQL for relational data mapping and migrations.
- AI Integration: Vercel AI SDK and Google Gemini for advanced model orchestration.
- Security Infrastructure: Passport-based middleware for multi-provider OAuth and JWT-based session management.

### Shared Infrastructure (packages/\*)

- @repo/ui: Standardized React component library and theme tokens.
- @repo/ai: Core AI orchestration logic and prompt management.
- @repo/trpc: Shared API contract ensuring full stack type safety.
- @repo/typescript-config: Centralized TypeScript configurations.
- @repo/eslint-config: Unified linting and code quality standards.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (v9 or higher)
- PostgreSQL

### Installation
